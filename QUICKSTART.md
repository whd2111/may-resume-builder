## Example Conversation Flow

**May:** Hi! I'm May, and I'm here to help you build an amazing resume. Let's start with the basics - what's your full name?

**You:** Will Dubbs

**May:** Great to meet you, Will! What's the best email and phone number to reach you?

**You:** whdubbs@gmail.com and 917-751-6583

**May:** Perfect. Now let's talk about your education. Where did you go to school and what did you study?

**You:** I have an MBA from Columbia Business School focusing on Product Management, graduating in 2026. I also have a BA in Government from Wesleyan University from 2014.

**May:** Excellent education background! Now let's dive into your work experience. Tell me about your most recent role.

**You:** I was a Product Management MBA Intern at Electronic Arts in 2025, working on their Ads and Sponsorships team.

**May:** That's a great company! Can you tell me about your main accomplishments in that role? What projects did you work on and what was YOUR specific contribution?

**You:** I built a Python tool that used LLMs to analyze Reddit users. We looked at over 4,600 users.

**May:** That's interesting! What impact did YOUR tool have? What specific business outcome resulted from your analysis?

**You:** It helped the sales team close $500K in new sponsorship deals because we could now quantify customer insights that weren't measurable before.

**May:** Perfect! That's exactly the kind of impact we want to highlight. Did you work on any other projects there?

... and so on!

## Tips for Best Results

### Do:
- ✅ Be specific about YOUR individual role
- ✅ Mention concrete numbers and metrics
- ✅ Describe the business impact
- ✅ Talk about the "why" behind your work

### Don't:
- ❌ Say "we did X" without clarifying your role
- ❌ Give vague descriptions like "helped with project"
- ❌ Skip the measurable outcomes
- ❌ Exaggerate or fabricate accomplishments

## What Makes a Great Bullet Point?

### Bad Example:
"Worked on a data analysis project for the team"

### Good Example:
"Built Python + LLM Reddit AI Agent tool analyzing 4,685+ users, enabling $500K in new sponsorship deals by quantifying previously unmeasurable customer insights"

The good example shows:
- **Action verb**: Built
- **What you did**: Python + LLM Reddit AI Agent tool
- **Scope**: 4,685+ users
- **Business impact**: $500K in new sponsorship deals
- **Value**: quantifying previously unmeasurable customer insights

## Tailoring for Jobs

Once you have your master resume:

1. Find a job posting you're interested in
2. Copy the ENTIRE job description
3. Paste it into Stage 2
4. Click "Tailor Resume"
5. May will rewrite your bullets to emphasize the most relevant experience for that specific role
