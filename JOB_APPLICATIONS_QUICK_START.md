- 🔵 **Tailored** - Purple badge (ready to apply)
- 🟢 **Applied** - Green badge (submitted to company)

## Finding Your Previous Tailored Resumes

**Important:** The 4 resumes you mentioned tailoring earlier **are not saved** because they were created before this feature was added. They only exist as downloaded DOCX files on your computer.

To get them in your dashboard:
1. Find the downloaded DOCX files
2. Re-tailor them using the "Tailor for Jobs" feature
3. Click "Save to Dashboard"

Or simply tailor new resumes going forward - they'll all be saved automatically!

## Tips

✨ **Best Practice:** Always use "Download & Save to Dashboard" in batch mode
📱 **Quick Access:** Your dashboard is your resume command center
📊 **Track Progress:** Mark applications as "Applied" to stay organized
🎯 **Never Lose Work:** All tailored resumes are safely stored in your account

## What Gets Saved

Each application stores:
- ✅ Job description (full text)
- ✅ Company name & job title
- ✅ Extracted job requirements (checklist)
- ✅ Bullet scoring results (which bullets were selected)
- ✅ Complete tailored resume (all data)
- ✅ Status (draft → tailored → applied)
- ✅ Creation timestamp

## Next Time You Tailor

Just click "Save to Dashboard" after tailoring any resume. It's that simple!
